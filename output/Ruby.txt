grows progressively larger.

Ivysaur
=======
There is a bud on this POKéMON’s back.
To support its weight, IVYSAUR’s legs
and trunk grow thick and strong.

If it starts spending more time lying
in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the
bud will bloom into a large flower soon.

Venusaur
========
There is a large flower on VENUSAUR’s
back. The flower is said to take on vivid
colors if it gets plenty of nutrition

and sunlight. The flower’s aroma
soothes the emotions of people.

Charmander

enjoying itself. If the POKéMON becomes
enraged, the flame burns fiercely.

foes using its sharp claws.
If it encounters a strong foe, it turns

aggressive. In this excited state, the
flame at the tip of its tail flares with a
bluish white color.

search of powerful opponents.
It breathes fire of such great heat

that it melts anything. However, it
never turns its fiery breath on any
opponent weaker than itself.

Squirtle
========
SQUIRTLE’s shell is not merely used
for protection.
The shell’s rounded shape and the

grooves on its surface help minimize
resistance in water, enabling this
POKéMON to swim at high speeds.

Wartortle
=========
Its tail is large and covered with a rich,
thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly
deeper in color as WARTORTLE ages.

The scratches on its shell are evidence
of this POKéMON’s toughness as a
battler.

Blastoise
=========
BLASTOISE has water spouts that
protrude from its shell. The water
spouts are very accurate.

They can shoot bullets of water with
enough accuracy to strike empty cans
from a distance of over 160 feet.

It can devour leaves bigger than its
body right before your eyes.

From its antenna, this POKéMON releases
a terrifically strong odor.

Metapod
=======
The shell covering this POKéMON’s body
is as hard as an iron slab.
METAPOD does not move very much.

search for delicious honey from
flowers.

It can even search out, extract, and
carry honey from flowers that are
blooming over six miles from its nest.

of smell.
It is capable of distinguishing its

favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big
red proboscis (nose).

clings to a tree. However, on the
inside, it is extremely busy as it

prepares for its coming evolution.
This is evident from how hot the shell
becomes to the touch.

BEEDRILL is extremely territorial.
No one should ever approach its nest -
this is for their own safety.

If angered, they will attack in a furious
swarm.

of direction.
It is capable of unerringly returning

home to its nest, however far it may be
removed from its familiar surroundings.

own territory. This POKéMON flies
around, patrolling its living space.

If its territory is violated, it shows
no mercy in thoroughly punishing the
foe with its sharp claws.

Pidgeot
=======
This POKéMON has a dazzling plumage of
beautifully glossy feathers.
Many TRAINERS are captivated by the

striking beauty of the feathers on its
head, compelling them to choose PIDGEOT
as their POKéMON.

Even while it is asleep, it constantly
listens by moving its ears around.

It is not picky about where it lives -
it will make its nest anywhere.

Raticate
========
RATICATE’s sturdy fangs grow steadily.
To keep them ground down, it gnaws
on rocks and logs.

It may even chew on the walls of
houses.

Spearow
=======

be heard over half a mile away.
If its high, keening cry is heard

echoing all around, it is a sign that
they are warning each other of danger.

and elongated beak.
They are conveniently shaped for

catching prey in soil or water.
It deftly moves its long and skinny
beak to pluck prey.

it rests.
Assuming this position allows it to

quickly respond to a threat from any
direction with a glare from its upraised
head.

Arbok
=====

order to constrict things with its body.
It can even flatten steel oil drums.

Once ARBOK wraps its body around its
foe, escaping its crunching embrace is
impossible.

Pikachu
=======
Whenever PIKACHU comes across
something new, it blasts it with a jolt
of electricity.

If you come across a blackened berry,
it’s evidence that this POKéMON
mistook the intensity of its charge.

======
If the electrical sacks become
excessively charged, RAICHU plants its
tail in the ground and discharges.

Scorched patches of ground will be
found near this POKéMON’s nest.

absorb water without waste, enabling it
to survive in an arid desert.

This POKéMON curls up to protect itself
from its enemies.

spikes, which are hardened sections of
its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall

out, to be replaced with new spikes that
grow out from beneath the old ones.

Nidoran♀
========
NIDORAN has barbs that secrete a
powerful poison. They are thought to
have developed as protection for this

small-bodied POKéMON.
When enraged, it releases a horrible
toxin from its horn.

Nidorina
========
When NIDORINA are with their friends or
family, they keep their barbs tucked
away to prevent hurting each other.

This POKéMON appears to become
nervous if separated from the others.

Nidoqueen
=========
NIDOQUEEN’s body is encased in
extremely hard scales. It is adept at
sending foes flying with harsh tackles.

This POKéMON is at its strongest when
it is defending its young.

Nidoran♂
========
The male NIDORAN has developed
muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to
them, the ears can be freely moved in

any direction. Even the slightest sound
does not escape this POKéMON’s notice.

Nidorino
========
NIDORINO has a horn that is harder than
a diamond. If it senses a hostile
presence, all the barbs on its back

bristle up at once, and it challenges
the foe with all its might.

Nidoking
========
NIDOKING’s thick tail packs enormously
destructive power. With one swing, it
can topple a metal transmission tower.

Once this POKéMON goes on a rampage,
there is no stopping it.

this POKéMON come out to play.
When dawn arrives, the tired CLEFAIRY

return to their quiet mountain retreats
and go to sleep nestled up against each
other.

it were flying using its wings. Its
bouncy step lets it even walk on water.

It is known to take strolls on lakes on
quiet, moonlit nights.

Vulpix
======
At the time of its birth, VULPIX has one
white tail. The tail separates into six
if this POKéMON receives plenty of love

from its TRAINER.
The six tails become magnificently
curled.

its bright red eyes to gain total
control over its foe’s mind.

This POKéMON is said to live for a
thousand years.

adjust the wavelength of its voice.
This POKéMON uses this ability to sing

at precisely the right wavelength to
make its foes most drowsy.

Wigglytuff
==========
WIGGLYTUFF has large, saucerlike eyes.
The surfaces of its eyes are always
covered with a thin layer of tears.

If any dust gets in this POKéMON’s
eyes, it is quickly washed away.

Zubat
=====
ZUBAT remains quietly unmoving in a
dark spot during the bright daylight
hours. It does so because prolonged

exposure to the sun causes its body to
become slightly burned.

Golbat
======
GOLBAT loves to drink the blood of
living things. It is particularly active
in the pitch black of night.

This POKéMON flits around in the night
skies, seeking fresh blood.

Oddish
======
During the daytime, ODDISH buries
itself in soil to absorb nutrients from 
the ground using its entire body.

The more fertile the soil, the glossier
its leaves become.

Gloom
=====
GLOOM releases a foul fragrance from
the pistil of its flower. When faced
with danger, the stench worsens.

If this POKéMON is feeling calm and
secure, it does not release its usual
stinky aroma.

Vileplume
=========
VILEPLUME’s toxic pollen triggers
atrocious allergy attacks. That’s why
it is advisable never to approach any

attractive flowers in a jungle, however
pretty they may be.

Paras
=====
PARAS has parasitic mushrooms growing
on its back called tochukaso. They grow
large by drawing nutrients from the BUG

POKéMON host. They are highly valued as
a medicine for extending life.

en masse and drain nutrients from the
lower trunk and roots.

When an infested tree dies, they move
onto another tree all at once.

VENONAT is said to have evolved with
a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers
its entire body for protection.

It possesses large eyes that never fail
to spot even miniscule prey.

Venomoth
========

that only becomes active at night.
Its favorite prey are small insects

that gather around streetlights,
attracted by the light in the darkness.

Diglett
=======
DIGLETT are raised in most farms.
The reason is simple - wherever this
POKéMON burrows, the soil is left

perfectly tilled for planting crops.
This soil is made ideal for growing
delicious vegetables.

Dugtrio
=======
DUGTRIO are actually triplets that
emerged from one body. As a result,
each triplet thinks exactly like the

other two triplets.
They work cooperatively to burrow
endlessly.

Meowth
======
MEOWTH withdraws its sharp claws into
its paws to slinkily sneak about without
making any incriminating footsteps.

For some reason, this POKéMON loves
shiny coins that glitter with light.

Persian
=======
PERSIAN has six bold whiskers that give
it a look of toughness. The whiskers  
sense air movements to determine what

is in the POKéMON’s surrounding
vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed
by the whiskers.

Psyduck
=======
PSYDUCK uses a mysterious power.
When it does so, this POKéMON 
generates brain waves that are

supposedly only seen in sleepers.
This discovery spurred controversy
among scholars.

Golduck
=======
The webbed flippers on its forelegs and
hind legs and the streamlined body of
GOLDUCK give it frightening speed.

This POKéMON is definitely much faster
than even the most athletic swimmer.

Mankey
======
When MANKEY starts shaking and its
nasal breathing turns rough, it’s a sure
sign that it is becoming angry.

However, because it goes into a
towering rage almost instantly, it is
impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.

Primeape
========
When PRIMEAPE becomes furious, its
blood circulation is boosted. In turn,
its muscles are made even stronger.

However, it also becomes much less
intelligent at the same time.

Growlithe
=========
GROWLITHE has a superb sense of smell.
Once it smells anything, this POKéMON
won’t forget the scent, no matter what.

It uses its advanced olfactory sense
to determine the emotions of other
living things.

6,200 miles in a single day and night.

The fire that blazes wildly within this
POKéMON’s body is its source of power.

Poliwag
=======
POLIWAG has a very thin skin. It is
possible to see the POKéMON’s spiral
innards right through the skin.

Despite its thinness, however, the skin
is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs
bounce right off it.

Poliwhirl
=========
The surface of POLIWHIRL’s body is
always wet and slick with an oily fluid.
Because of this greasy covering, it can

easily slip and slide out of the clutches
of any enemy in battle.

Poliwrath
=========

muscles never grow fatigued, however
much it exercises.

It is so tirelessly strong, this POKéMON
can swim back and forth across the
Pacific Ocean without effort.

However, it can sense the presence of
foes even while it is sleeping.

In such a situation, this POKéMON
immediately teleports to safety.

if it develops a headache. Only those
people with a particularly strong

psyche can hope to become a TRAINER
of this POKéMON.

Alakazam
========
ALAKAZAM’s brain continually grows,
making its head far too heavy to
support with its neck.

This POKéMON holds its head up using
its psychokinetic power instead.

never get sore no matter how much they
are used in exercise.

This POKéMON has sufficient power to
hurl a hundred adult humans.

Machoke
=======
MACHOKE’s thoroughly toned muscles
possess the hardness of steel.
This POKéMON has so much strength,

it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler
on just one finger.

aside. However, trying to do any work
requiring care and dexterity causes

its arms to get tangled.
This POKéMON tends to leap into action
before it thinks.

Bellsprout
==========

lets it bend and sway to avoid any
attack, however strong it may be.

From its mouth, this POKéMON spits a
corrosive fluid that melts even iron.

Weepinbell
==========

end. At night, the POKéMON hooks on to
a tree branch and goes to sleep.

If it moves around in its sleep, it may
wake up to find itself on the ground.

Victreebel
==========
VICTREEBEL has a long vine that
extends from its head. This vine is
waved and flicked about as if it were

an animal to attract prey. When an
unsuspecting prey draws near, this
POKéMON swallows it whole.

Tentacool
=========
TENTACOOL’s body is largely composed
of water. If it is removed from the
sea, it dries up like parchment.

If this POKéMON happens to become
dehydrated, put it back into the sea.

Tentacruel
==========
TENTACRUEL has large red orbs on its
head. The orbs glow before lashing the
vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast.

This POKéMON’s outburst creates rough
waves around it.

Geodude
=======
The longer a GEODUDE lives, the more
its edges are chipped and worn away,
making it more rounded in appearance.

However, this POKéMON’s heart will
remain hard, craggy, and rough always.

Graveler
========
GRAVELER grows by feeding on rocks.
Apparently, it prefers to eat rocks
that are covered in moss.

This POKéMON eats its way through
a ton of rocks on a daily basis.

Golem
=====
GOLEM live up on mountains.
If there is a large earthquake, these
POKéMON will come rolling down off

the mountains en masse to the
foothills below.

Ponyta
======
PONYTA is very weak at birth.
It can barely stand up.
This POKéMON becomes stronger by

stumbling and falling to keep up with
its parent.

Rapidash
========
RAPIDASH usually can be seen casually
cantering in the fields and plains.
However, when this POKéMON turns

serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze
as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.

Slowpoke
========
SLOWPOKE uses its tail to catch prey by
dipping it in water at the side of a
river.

However, this POKéMON often forgets
what it’s doing and often spends entire
days just loafing at water’s edge.

Slowbro
=======
SLOWBRO’s tail has a SHELLDER firmly
attached with a bite. As a result, the
tail can’t be used for fishing anymore.

This causes SLOWBRO to grudgingly swim
and catch prey instead.

Magnemite
=========
MAGNEMITE attaches itself to power
lines to feed on electricity.
If your house has a power outage,

check your circuit breakers. You may
find a large number of this POKéMON
clinging to the breaker box.

Magneton
========
MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic
force that is fatal to mechanical
devices. As a result, large cities sound

sirens to warn citizens of large-scale
outbreaks of this POKéMON.

Farfetch'd
==========
FARFETCH’D is always seen with a stick
from a plant of some sort. Apparently,
there are good sticks and bad sticks.

This POKéMON has been known to fight
with others over sticks.

Doduo
=====
DODUO’s two heads never sleep at the
same time.
Its two heads take turns sleeping,

so one head can always keep watch for
enemies while the other one sleeps.

Dodrio
======
Watch out if DODRIO’s three heads are
looking in three separate directions.
It’s a sure sign that it is on its guard.

Don’t go near this POKéMON if it’s being
wary - it may decide to peck you.

Seel
====
SEEL hunts for prey in the frigid sea
underneath sheets of ice.
When it needs to breathe, it punches

a hole through the ice with the
sharply protruding section of its head.

cold ice.
The sight of this POKéMON sleeping on

a glacier was mistakenly thought to be
a mermaid by a mariner long ago.

GRIMER’s sludgy and rubbery body can
be forced through any opening, however
small it may be.

This POKéMON enters sewer pipes to
drink filthy wastewater.

Muk
===

gives off a nose-bendingly horrible
stench.

Just one drop of this POKéMON’s body
fluid can turn a pool stagnant and
rancid.

Shellder
========

tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor
sand and then sleep in it.

While it is sleeping, SHELLDER closes its
shell, but leaves its tongue hanging
out.

sea. It does so by swallowing water,
then jetting it out toward the rear.

This POKéMON shoots spikes from its
shell using the same system.

If one beckons you while floating in
darkness, you must never approach it.

This POKéMON will try to lick you with its
tongue and steal your life away.

Gengar
======
Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow
thrown by a streetlight will suddenly
and startlingly overtake you.

It is actually a GENGAR running past
you, pretending to be your shadow.

Onix
====
ONIX has a magnet in its brain. It acts
as a compass so that this POKéMON does
not lose direction while it is tunneling.

As it grows older, its body becomes
increasingly rounder and smoother.

Drowzee
=======
If your nose becomes itchy while you
are sleeping, it’s a sure sign that one
of these POKéMON is standing above

your pillow and trying to eat your dream
through your nostrils.

Hypno
=====
HYPNO holds a pendulum in its hand.
The arcing movement and glitter of the
pendulum lull the foe into a deep state

of hypnosis.
While this POKéMON searches for prey,
it polishes the pendulum.

holes dug into the sand.
On sandy beaches with little in the way

of food, these POKéMON can be seen
squabbling with each other over
territory.

Kingler
=======

claw. It waves this huge claw in the
air to communicate with others.

However, because the claw is so heavy,
the POKéMON quickly tires.

Voltorb
=======

that manufactures POKé BALLS.
The link between that sighting and

the fact that this POKéMON looks very
similar to a POKé BALL remains a
mystery.

Electrode
=========
ELECTRODE eats electricity in the
atmosphere. On days when lightning
strikes, you can see this POKéMON

exploding all over the place from
eating too much electricity.

Exeggcute
=========
This POKéMON consists of six eggs that
form a closely knit cluster. The six eggs
attract each other and spin around.

When cracks increasingly appear on the
eggs, EXEGGCUTE is close to evolution.

tropics. Its heads steadily grow larger
from exposure to strong sunlight.

It is said that when the heads fall off,
they group together to form EXEGGCUTE.

Cubone
======

never see again. Seeing a likeness of
its mother in the full moon, it cries.

The stains on the skull the POKéMON
wears are made by the tears it sheds.

that has overcome its sadness at the
loss of its mother and grown tough.

This POKéMON’s tempered and hardened
spirit is not easily broken.

spirit of a boxer who had been working
towards a world championship.

This POKéMON has an indomitable spirit
and will never give up in the face of
adversity.

Lickitung

something new, it will unfailingly give it
a lick. It does so because it memorizes

things by texture and by taste.
It is somewhat put off by sour things.

Koffing

the toxicity of its internal gases and
jets them out from all over its body.

This POKéMON may also overinflate its
round body, then explode.

Weezing
=======

make it its home. At night, when the
people in the house are asleep, it will
go through the trash.

Rhyhorn
=======

smashing everything in its path.
It is not bothered even if it rushes

headlong into a block of steel.

diamonds. One sweeping blow of its tail
can topple a building.

This POKéMON’s hide is extremely tough.
Even direct cannon hits don’t leave
a scratch.

eggs on an everyday basis.
The eggs are so delicious, they are

easily and eagerly devoured by even
those people who have lost their
appetite.

are grabbed. This happens without pain,
allowing it to make a quick getaway.

The lost vines are replaced by newly
grown vines the very next day.

Kangaskhan
==========
If you come across a young KANGASKHAN
playing by itself, you must never
disturb it or attempt to catch it.

The baby POKéMON’s parent is sure to
be in the area, and it will become
violently enraged at you.

Horsea
======
HORSEA eats small insects and moss off
of rocks. If the ocean current turns
fast, this POKéMON anchors itself by

wrapping its tail around rocks or coral
to prevent being washed away.

between the branches of coral.
Those trying to harvest coral are

occasionally stung by this POKéMON’s
poison barbs if they fail to notice it.

with fins that billow elegantly in water.
However, don’t let your guard down

around this POKéMON - it could ram you
powerfully with its horn.

seen performing courtship dances in
riverbeds to woo females.

During this season, this POKéMON’s body
coloration is at its most beautiful.

Staryu
======
STARYU’s center section has an organ
called the core that shines bright red.
If you go to a beach toward the

end of summer, the glowing cores of
these POKéMON look like the stars
in the sky.

Starmie
=======
STARMIE’s center section - the core -
glows brightly in seven colors.
Because of its luminous nature, this

POKéMON has been given the nickname
“the gem of the sea.”

Mr. Mime
========
MR. MIME is a master of pantomime.
Its gestures and motions convince
watchers that something unseeable

actually exists. Once it is believed,
it will exist as if it were a real thing.

Scyther
=======

speed enhances the effectiveness of
the twin scythes on its forearms.

This POKéMON’s scythes are so
effective, they can slice through thick
logs in one wicked stroke.

Jynx
====
JYNX walks rhythmically, swaying and
shaking its hips as if it were dancing.
Its motions are so bouncingly alluring,

people seeing it are compelled to shake
their hips without giving any thought
to what they are doing.

Electabuzz
==========
When a storm arrives, gangs of this
POKéMON compete with each other to
scale heights that are likely to be

stricken by lightning bolts.
Some towns use ELECTABUZZ in place of
lightning rods.

hot flames from all over its body to
intimidate its opponent.

This POKéMON’s fiery bursts create
heat waves that ignite grass and trees
in its surroundings.

grip a foe weighing twice its weight
in its horns and easily lift it.

This POKéMON’s movements turn sluggish
in cold places.

Tauros
======

it is rampaging at all times.
If there is no opponent for TAUROS to

battle, it will charge at thick trees and
knock them down to calm itself.

Magikarp
========
MAGIKARP is a pathetic excuse for a
POKéMON that is only capable of
flopping and splashing.

This behavior prompted scientists to
undertake research into it.

Gyarados
========
When MAGIKARP evolves into GYARADOS,
its brain cells undergo a structural
transformation. It is said that this

transformation is to blame for this
POKéMON’s wildly violent nature.

Lapras
======
People have driven LAPRAS almost to the
point of extinction. In the evenings,
this POKéMON is said to sing plaintively

as it seeks what few others of its kind
still remain.

Ditto
=====

transform itself into other shapes.
However, if it tries to transform itself

into something by relying on its memory,
this POKéMON manages to get details
wrong.

Eevee
=====
EEVEE has an unstable genetic makeup
that suddenly mutates due to the
environment in which it lives.

Radiation from various STONES causes
this POKéMON to evolve.

mutation and grew fins and gills that
allow it to live underwater.

This POKéMON has the ability to freely
control water.

Jolteon
=======
JOLTEON’s cells generate a low level of
electricity. This power is amplified by
the static electricity of its fur,

enabling the POKéMON to drop
thunderbolts. The bristling fur is made
of electrically charged needles.

Flareon
=======
FLAREON’s fluffy fur has a functional
purpose - it releases heat into the air
so that its body does not get

excessively hot.
This POKéMON’s body temperature can
rise to a maximum of 1,650 degrees F.

Porygon
=======

composition of all POKéMON.
It is capable of making itself invisible

at will, so it entirely avoids notice even
if it approaches people.

Chikorita

========
Once CROCONAW has clamped its jaws on
its foe, it will absolutely not let go.
Because the tips of its fangs are

forked back like barbed fishhooks, they
become impossible to remove when 
they have sunk in.

senses and tracks the earth’s rotation.
Using this special organ, this POKéMON

begins hooting at precisely the same
time every day.

Noctowl

considered its second nervous system.
It is said that this POKéMON can

determine what kind of prey is touching
its web just by the tiny vibrations it
feels through the web’s strands.

hooked claws that enable it to scuttle
on ceilings and vertical walls.

This POKéMON constricts the foe with
thin and strong silk webbing.

Crobat
======
If this POKéMON is flying by fluttering
only a pair of wings on either the
forelegs or hind legs, it’s proof that

CROBAT has been flying a long distance.
It switches the wings it uses if it is
tired.

Chinchou
========

brings good fortune. When the POKéMON
spots someone who is pure of heart,

it is said to appear and share its
happiness with that person.

spot all day long. People believe that
this POKéMON does so out of fear of

the terrible things it has foreseen in

of sunlight, the leaves ringing its body
begin to spin around.

This POKéMON’s dancing is renowned in
the southern lands.

Marill
======
MARILL’s oil-filled tail acts much like
a life preserver. If you see just its
tail bobbing on the water’s surface,

it’s a sure indication that this POKéMON
is diving beneath the water to feed on
aquatic plants.

Azumarill
=========

sensors. By focusing its hearing, this
POKéMON can identify what kinds of

prey are around, even in rough and
fast-running rivers.

Sudowoodo

to avoid being attacked by enemies.
However, because the forelegs remain

green throughout the year, the POKéMON
is easily identified as a fake during
the winter.

proof of its status as a king. It is said
that the longer and more curled the

hair, the more respect this POKéMON
earns from its peers.

cross the sea and fly to foreign lands.
The POKéMON descends to the ground

when it encounters cold air while it is
floating.

appendage that can be cleverly
manipulated.

However, because the POKéMON uses its
tail so much, its real hands have become
rather clumsy.

Sunkern
=======
SUNKERN tries to move as little as it
possibly can. It does so because it
tries to conserve all the nutrients it

has stored in its body for its
evolution. It will not eat a thing, 
subsisting only on morning dew.
