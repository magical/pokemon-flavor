back. The flower is said to take on vivid
colors if it gets plenty of nutrition

and sunlight. The flower’s aroma

for protection.
The shell’s rounded shape and the

grooves on its surface help minimize
resistance in water, enabling this
POKéMON to swim at high speeds.

Wartortle

thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly
deeper in color as WARTORTLE ages.

of smell.
It is capable of distinguishing its

favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big
red proboscis (nose).

powerful poison. They are thought to
have developed as protection for this

small-bodied POKéMON.
When enraged, it releases a horrible
toxin from its horn.

Nidorina

When NIDORINA are with their friends or
family, they keep their barbs tucked
away to prevent hurting each other.

This POKéMON appears to become
nervous if separated from the others.

extremely hard scales. It is adept at
sending foes flying with harsh tackles.

This POKéMON is at its strongest when
it is defending its young.

them, the ears can be freely moved in

any direction. Even the slightest sound
does not escape this POKéMON’s notice.

a diamond. If it senses a hostile
presence, all the barbs on its back

bristle up at once, and it challenges
the foe with all its might.

being when nine wizards possessing
sacred powers merged into one.

This POKéMON is highly intelligent - it
can understand human speech.

pauses to breathe. If it is in a battle
against an opponent that does not

easily fall asleep, JIGGLYPUFF cannot
breathe, endangering its life.

By inhaling deeply, this POKéMON can
inflate itself seemingly without end.

Once inflated, WIGGLYTUFF bounces

that only becomes active at night.
Its favorite prey are small insects

that gather around streetlights,
attracted by the light in the darkness.

POKéMON burrows, the soil is left

perfectly tilled for planting crops.
This soil is made ideal for growing
delicious vegetables.

emerged from one body. As a result,
each triplet thinks exactly like the

other two triplets.

its paws to slinkily sneak about without
making any incriminating footsteps.

For some reason, this POKéMON loves
shiny coins that glitter with light.

it a look of toughness. The whiskers  
sense air movements to determine what

is in the POKéMON’s surrounding
vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed
by the whiskers.

PSYDUCK can’t remember having done so.
It apparently can’t form a memory of

such an event because it goes into
an altered state that is much like
deep sleep.

all POKéMON. It swims effortlessly, even
in a rough, stormy sea.

It sometimes rescues people from
wrecked ships floundering in high seas.

nasal breathing turns rough, it’s a sure
sign that it is becoming angry.

is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs
bounce right off it.

the base to the summit, crunchingly

feasting on rocks all the while.
Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back
down to the bottom.

serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze
as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.

dipping it in water at the side of a
river.

However, this POKéMON often forgets
what it’s doing and often spends entire
days just loafing at water’s edge.

Slowbro
=======
SLOWBRO’s tail has a SHELLDER firmly
attached with a bite. As a result, the
tail can’t be used for fishing anymore.

This causes SLOWBRO to grudgingly swim
and catch prey instead.

electromagnetic waves from the units
at its sides. These waves block gravity.

This POKéMON becomes incapable of
flight if its internal electrical supply
is depleted.

identical brains.
A scientific study reported that on

rare occasions, there will be examples
of this POKéMON possessing different
sets of brains.

Dodrio
======
Apparently, the heads aren’t the only
parts of the body that DODRIO has
three of.

It has three sets of hearts and lungs
as well, so it is capable of running long
distances without rest.

underneath sheets of ice.
When it needs to breathe, it punches

a hole through the ice with the

thrown by a streetlight will suddenly
and startlingly overtake you.

eggs on an everyday basis.
The eggs are so delicious, they are

easily and eagerly devoured by even
those people who have lost their
appetite.

reflexively spray a dense black ink
from its mouth and try to escape.

effective, they can slice through thick
logs in one wicked stroke.

their hips without giving any thought
to what they are doing.

electricity. This power is amplified by
the static electricity of its fur,

enabling the POKéMON to drop
thunderbolts. The bristling fur is made
of electrically charged needles.

Flareon
=======
FLAREON’s fluffy fur has a functional
purpose - it releases heat into the air
so that its body does not get

excessively hot.
This POKéMON’s body temperature can
rise to a maximum of 1,650 degrees F.

composition of all POKéMON.
It is capable of making itself invisible

at will, so it entirely avoids notice even
if it approaches people.

Chikorita

massive jaws. The steel jaws are really
horns that have been transformed.
